- **Memory:** Increased limits and optimized settings
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced process monitoring

### Server Optimizations
- **Async I/O:** All file operations are now non-blocking
- **Error Handling:** Improved async error handling
- **Caching:** Better duration and thumbnail caching

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

1. **Update PM2 Configuration:**
   ```bash
   pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js --env production
   ```

2. **Reload Nginx Configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
   sudo nginx -s reload  # Reload if test passes
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance:**
   ```bash
   pm2 monit  # Monitor PM2 processes
   node test-performance.js  # Run performance tests
   ```

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
